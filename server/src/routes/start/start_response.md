Okay, I understand. We have a 14-year-old male presenting with knee pain as the chief complaint.

**Summary:**

* **Patient:** 14-year-old male
* **Primary Concern:** Knee pain

**Initial Guidance & Potential Questions (for the clinician):**

Given the patient's age, possible causes could include:

* **Overuse injuries:** Common in active teenagers (e.g., Osgood-Schlatter disease, patellofemoral pain syndrome).
* **Growth-related pain:** Growing pains.
* **Trauma:** Sports-related injuries, falls, etc.
* **Less common possibilities:** Infection, inflammatory conditions, or anatomical abnormalities.

**Therefore, the clinician might want to inquire about:**

* **Onset:** When did the pain start? Was it sudden or gradual?
* **Location:** Where exactly in the knee is the pain?
* **Character:** What does the pain feel like (sharp, dull, aching, throbbing)?
* **Aggravating/Relieving Factors:** What makes the pain worse or better? Specifically, inquire about activity level, rest, and medications.
* **Associated Symptoms:** Is there any swelling, stiffness, clicking, locking, giving way, or decreased range of motion?
* **History of Trauma:** Any recent injuries or falls?
* **Activity Level:** Participation in sports or other physical activities? Type and intensity?
* **Medical History:** Any previous knee problems, other medical conditions, or medications?
* **Family History:** Any family history of arthritis or other joint problems?

This information will help the clinician determine the appropriate course of action.
